However, upon loading the model, we encountered a warning indicating that the question answering head (`qa_outputs`) was not properly saved. This means that while the core BERT encoder layers were correctly restored, the classification layer responsible for predicting answer spans was randomly initialized. As a result, evaluation on the PQuAD test set yielded unreasonably low F1 and EM scores, which do not reflect the model's true potential.\n","\n","Given this situation, we cannot trust the current evaluation results on PQuAD, since the model is essentially missing its fine-tuned QA capabilities. Re-training the QA head on PQuAD might help recover its original performance, but it is not strictly necessary. The key insight is that the transformer layers—the part of the model responsible for understanding Persian language—have already been trained on PQuAD. This deep representation can still be valuable for downstream tasks, even if the classification head needs to be retrained.\n","\n","Therefore, instead of re-tuning the model on PQuAD, we can move directly to fine-tuning it on a new dataset such as PersianQA. During this process, the QA head will be trained from scratch on PersianQA examples, while the underlying encoder layers provide strong contextual understanding from previous training. This approach saves time and allows us to adapt the model to a new domain without redundant re-training on PQuAD.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7FlxQELBL21P"},"source":["# **Fine

Although promising in theory, this approach had two major issues:\n","  - **Training became very slow** (~1.5 hours per epoch on BERT),\n","  - **Convergence was difficult** — even after an epoch, there was no clear improvement in accuracy.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### Approach 3: Add LoRA to Handle No-Answer\n","\n","- Added **LoRA** to help preserve performance on answerable data and improve on
